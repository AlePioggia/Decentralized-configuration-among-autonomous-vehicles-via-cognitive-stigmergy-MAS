# Decentralized configuration among autonomous vehicles via cognitive stigmergy: Design of a multi-agent system

This project concerns the creation of a multi-agent system that manages the coordination and modeling of autonomous vehicles. Its distinctive feature is the approach to communication and coordination between agents, which is entirely based on the concept of cognitive stigmergy.
